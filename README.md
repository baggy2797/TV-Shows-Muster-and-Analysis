## Why do we need it?
Online entertainment has become a crucial part of life in the modern age. In recent times, the amount of content and the number of content producers has increased exponentially. With such an increased consumption of content, everyone has opinions about different TV shows and water cooler discussions have become commonplace. People take to different social media forums to express what they think and connect with the world at large. This provides data scientists and researchers a unique opportunity to study the pulse of the public about a specific show easily. We analyze reviews and tweets talking about TV shows by performing sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and social network analysis. We see that shows with positive reviews and chatter also have a higher rating. We designed a smooth web interface to demonstrate some of the visualizations for the data we collected as part of this project. We allow users to check out reviews based on a range of sentiment scores. These scores have been calculated by us earlier in the project. Additionally, users can also see a list of TV shows rated higher than a threshold. Our publicly available link is https://team-fire-viz.herokuapp.com/.
